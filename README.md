For this project we visited earthquake datasets from the United States Geological Survey (USGS). USGS updates their json files daily with up to date information on the latest earthquakes around the globe. I selected a dataset of earthquakes that were of 4.5 magnitude or greater in the past month. I mapped out the dataset using Leaflet, with depth of the earthquakes shown by lighter and darker circle markers, and the magnitude of the earthquakes shown by the size of the radius of the circle marker.
